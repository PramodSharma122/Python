# 'is' vs '==' in python:

a=[1,2,43]
b=[1,2,43]
print(a is b) # 'is' is exact location of object in memory.
print(a==b) # compare the value


a=3
b=3
print(a is b) # 'is' is exact location of object in memory.
print(a==b) # compare the value


a="Hello"
b="Hello"
print(a is b) # 'is' is exact location of object in memory.
print(a==b) # compare the value
